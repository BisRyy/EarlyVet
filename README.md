## **How It Works**

1. **User Authentication**:

   - Users (farmers or veterinarians) authenticate through the User Management Service.

2. **Livestock Registration**:

   - Farmers register livestock details via the Livestock Management Service.

3. **Sensor Data Collection**:

   - Sensor Sender sends real-time data to the Sensor Server.
   - Sensor Server processes and stores sensor data for analysis.

4. **Disease Prediction**:

   - Prediction Service processes livestock and sensor data using machine learning.
   - Prediction results are sent to the Notification Service via RabbitMQ.

5. **Notifications**:

   - Farmers and veterinarians receive alerts about potential diseases via email or SMS.

6. **Telemedicine**:
   - Farmers book appointments with veterinarians through the Telemedicine Service.
   - Consultations occur via the Video Chat Service.

   kubectl apply -f rabbit/manifests/
   ```
2. Deploy Each Service:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <service-directory>/manifests/
   ```
3. Verify Deployments:
