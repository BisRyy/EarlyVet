**RabbitMQ on Kubernetes**
This document describes the deployment of RabbitMQ, a popular open-source message broker, on a Kubernetes cluster using various Kubernetes resources.
**Deployment Overview**
The deployment leverages the following Kubernetes resources:
**StatefulSet:** Manages a set of pods running RabbitMQ containers. RabbitMQ requires persistent storage for message data, and a StatefulSet ensures pods are restarted in a specific order while maintaining their storage.
**Service:** Exposes the RabbitMQ deployment as a ClusterIP service within the Kubernetes cluster.
**Secret:** Stores sensitive information like passwords for RabbitMQ authentication.
**PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):** Requests storage space for RabbitMQ data.
**ConfigMap**: Holds configuration options for RabbitMQ.
Ingress (Optional): Exposes RabbitMQ services externally through an Ingress controller, allowing access from outside the Kubernetes cluster (requires additional configuration).
**Resource Details**
StatefulSet:
Name: rabbitmq
Image: rabbitmq:3-management (RabbitMQ container image with management tools)
Ports: 
15672 (HTTP for management)
5672 (AMQP messaging protocol)
Environment Variables: 
Configured from rabbitmq-configmap and rabbitmq-secret secrets.
Volume Mounts: 
/var/lib/rabbitmq: Persistent storage for RabbitMQ data claimed by rabbitmq-pvc.
Service:
Name: rabbitmq
Type: ClusterIP (accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster)
Exposes ports 15672 and 5672 from the RabbitMQ pods.
Secret:
Name: rabbitmq-secret
Stores sensitive information for RabbitMQ (replace "PLACEHOLDER" with actual values).
PersistentVolumeClaim:
Name: rabbitmq-pvc
Requests 1Gi of storage for RabbitMQ data.
Requires a corresponding PersistentVolume to be provisioned in your cluster.
**ConfigMap:**
Name: rabbitmq-configmap
Stores RabbitMQ configuration options (replace "PLACEHOLDER" with actual configurations).
Ingress (Optional):
Name: rabbitmq-ingress
Exposes RabbitMQ services externally through hostnames: 
rabbitmq-manager.com (for management on port 15672)
rabbitmq.com (for AMQP messaging on port 5672)
Requires an Ingress controller to be configured in your Kubernetes cluster.
**Deployment Steps**
Create the RabbitMQ secrets (rabbitmq-secret.yaml) with your desired credentials.
Create the RabbitMQ config map (rabbitmq-configmap.yaml) with your RabbitMQ configuration options.
Create the PersistentVolumeClaim (rabbitmq-pvc.yaml) to request storage for RabbitMQ data.
Create the RabbitMQ StatefulSet (rabbitmq-statefulset.yaml) to deploy RabbitMQ pods.
Create the RabbitMQ service (rabbitmq-service.yaml) to expose the deployment internally.
(Optional) Create the RabbitMQ Ingress (rabbitmq-ingress.yaml) for external access.
**Notes**
This is a basic example and might require adjustments based on your specific requirements.
Make sure you have a PersistentVolume provisioned in your cluster to fulfill the storage request of the PersistentVolumeClaim.
Update the secrets and config map with your desired values before deployment.
The Ingress resource requires an Ingress controller to be operational in your Kubernetes cluster for external access.
